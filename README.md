# 03-Password-Generator
This is the homework assignment for week 3 at UW Coding Bootcamp. The assignment is to write the function within the provide script that will create the password based on the user's criteria. The assignment here was to have us work with the new found knowledge to work on basic functions within JavaScript. The HTML and CSS were provided.

## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
## Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## My Journey
```
This turned out to be doozy of a challenge for me at first but with study and great tutors the basic concepts of JavaScript became easy muscle memory. Originally while starting I looked into some examples of this being done, but true coding there are many ways to go about one thing. This left me just trying out some of the things that I learned for myself and seeing if anything worked. Unfortunately just jumping into the script did not yield me high results, but this was a blessing in disguise. Probably because my first attempt at the script I was bouncing around all sorts of code trying anything to get me the answers I wanted this just did nothing for me and I had to scrap my first script file all together.

Not being able to just jump into the VSC program and start getting everything I needed to make the page ended up being such a good thing because it made me take pseudo coding much more serious. Mapping out exactly what I needed from my script to do, where to do it, and when was very essential for me to figuring this assignment out. 

Once all of my pseudo code was made and I was ready to tackle the actual code, I dove head first. Making all the variables and then mapping out statements so I just needed to fill what happens when the statements are true. 

Eventually I hit a road block at the end when my password was not showing, but this was a simple mistake of still being a beginner and not knowing all the rules to values, and functions.

Anthony Brown, Dan Mont-Eton and TAs - A shoutout to my teachers as their example of the pseudocode was very very knowledgeable and really helped turn this assignment around fast.

learnjavascript.online - This site was extremely helpful for a new user to JavaScript as it ran me through the basics and made me code simple functions and console.logs to make sure I understood the basics.
